## Context

This is a solution that aims at finding companies present in multiple CRMs, to build a bunch of different features for companies.
Here are the main definitions of the keywords we use:

- B2B: Business to Business, e.g. companies whose product or service targets other companies (as opposed to B2C or C2C, where C stands for individual customer)
- CRM: Customer Relationship Management, a tool used by companies to manage the lifecycle of their targets & customer
- Prospect: a company that is in a CRM but not yet a customer
- Customer: a company that has already purchased / subscribed to a product or service
- Match: a pair of CRM records representing a company, that are representing similar entities. It could be an exact match (representing exactly the same company), or a close match (entities of the same group for instance)
